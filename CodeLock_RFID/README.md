## RFID Code Lock with 125KHz Tag
It made with `RF01D_ID3_Memory` module. Processing tasks do by the module. We add or delete new cards with two keys. It's a very easy project.
I have tested it many times and worked great.

Note: `RF01D_ID3_Memory` module is only available in the Iranian market. I don't know, Is there like the module in other country?
